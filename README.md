# Jurrasic Park Puzzle
This is a small program written for my sons 11th birthday party.  We turned the house into an escape room for him and his friends to get through made of his favorite things and this was to mimic the first jurrasic park movie where they needed to reset the power to get the dinosaurs locked back up.  You can change the timer by minutes or seconds by passing integer values to the timer component inside of the App.jsx file.  

You pass the values of minutes and seconds by using initialMinute or initialSeconds props.  Both props have default values of 0 so you in most cases only need to set initialMinute and can skip initialMinutes.  There are both success and failure messages based on if the right 4 digit code is entered in time or not.  passcode needs to be set at the top of both the Timer.jsx component and the Passcode.jsx component though this should probably be made a prop to simplify it in both locations.  

I left the passcode as not props simply because in the small amount of time I had to complete this in time for his party I didnt have the time and for some reason it was easier for me to work with it the way it is currently.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
